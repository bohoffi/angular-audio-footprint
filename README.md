# AudioVisualizer

## Angular Notes

This project built using [@angular/cli@1.0.3](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).
Further using @angular@4.1.2.

## How it works

The app utilizes the Web Audio API to analyse and visualize the selected audio file.
Just pause the playback or wait until the end to view the resulting footprint rendered using d3.js

It's even possible to zoom and drag the resulting graphic.
